# EventSquirrel

"All your nuts in one place"

## What is EventSquirrel?

First and foremost, EventSquirrel is a collaborative project for some developer friends to work together on while they search for jobs. We don't want to spin any kind of illusions that this will become "the next big" anything. This is just a pet app project for some people to work together and that maybe, who knows, people will use.  

## The Pitch

EventSquirrel would be an egalitarian event brochure mobile app for festivals, conventions, conferences, etc. Really, any kind of gathering that has a series of scheduled events could sign up to have all of their event information available to their attendees in an elegant native mobile experience on Android or iOS. 

The kind of information that would be able to be added for every event on EventSquirrel:
- a multi-day schedule of talks/panels/performances, each with its own detail page that shows the panelists/performers images, socials, etc.
- venue information: including addresses and links to open in native map app 
- event policy information like code of conduct
- event contact information
- event sponsors
- vendor information

App users search through a list of registered events and choose any number to "bookmark". Then they're able to switch between these events (much like a user switching between Workspaces on Slack or servers on Discord) without leaving the app. At the moment, they wouldn't need to login, their bookmarked events would be saved in local storage. 

Many local event organizers are putting together small yearly events with shoe string budgets and would never dream of having a custom mobile app built for them. Companies that create event mobile apps are all taking a similar approach of offering custom tailored, highly complex, branded experiences that could only be within the budget of enterprise-backed events [[1]](https://spotme.com/product/event-app/)[[2]](https://www.bizzabo.com/product/mobile-event-app)[[3]](https://www.crowdcomms.com/event-technology/)[[4]](https://whova.com/whova-event-app/)[[5]](https://www.app4event.com/conference).  

But what if there was a free (for the foreseeable future) one-size-fits-everyone-else solution that just worked? Imagine how many events would jump on board. Imagine how many event attendees would have their experiences improved by having scheduling and event information easily accessible on their personal device?
